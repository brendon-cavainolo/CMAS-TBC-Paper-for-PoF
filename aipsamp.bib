abstract = {When a turbine airfoil attains temperatures that allow calcium–magnesium–alumino-silicate (CMAS) infiltration into the thermal barrier coating (TBC), a new mechanism of in-service spalling may be activated. The mechanism is associated with cold shock of the infiltrated layer during shut down. It has been identified by inspecting an airfoil removed from service. The identification has been based on observations of sub-surface delaminations within infiltrated regions of the TBC. Three important aspects of the mechanism are as follows. (a) The sub-surface delaminations always initiate at surface-connected vertical separations. (b) They are fully-infiltrated with CMAS. (c) They are strictly mode I. A thermal shock analysis has been invoked to identify a critical infiltration thickness, above which delaminations are possible. The analysis also defines a characteristic depth beneath the surface at which the delaminations are most likely. The observations made on the airfoils are consistent with these two dimensions. A second mechanism has been explored as the potential cause of large spalled regions also observed on the airfoils. But it has not been possible to verify the mechanism using the current observations.}

The assessment has been conducted on stationary components (especially shrouds) with relatively thick TBCs after removal from aero-engines. In those segments that experience the highest temperatures, the CMAS melts, penetrates to a depth about half the coating thickness, and infiltrates all open areas. Therein the TBC develops channel cracks and sub-surface delaminations, as well as spalls. Estimates of the residual stress gradients made on cross-sections (by using the Raman peak shift) indicate tension at the surface, becoming compressive below. By invoking mechanics relevant to the thermo-elastic stresses upon cooling, as well as the propagation of channel cracks and delaminations, a scenario has been presented that rationalizes these experimental findings. Self-consistent estimates of the stress and temperature gradients are presented as well as predictions of channel cracking and delamination upon cooling.}

Si and Ca in the CMAS rapidly penetrated the coating at 1250°C and accelerated sintering of the coating. At the interface between the CMAS and YSZ coating, the YSZ coating was partially dissolved in the CMAS, inducing the phase transformation from tetragonal phase to monoclinic phase. Also, the porosity of the coating was reduced from ∼25% to 5%. As a result, the thermal diffusivity at 1200°C increased from 0.3mm2/s to 0.7mm2/s, suggesting a significant degradation in the thermal barrier effect. Also, the coating showed a ∼40% increase in the microhardness. The degradation mechanism of TBC induced by CMAS was discussed.}

The thermal properties of a 7wt.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC deposited on a superalloy substrate by air plasma spray (APS) were measured before and after CMAS infiltration. A rise in both volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coating was observed upon infiltration. Calculations to explain these trends were performed for a model TBC system and found to be in good agreement with the measured results. The evolution of the phase constitution of the coating was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and the integrity of the interface was characterized by optical examination of cross sections.

ABSTRACT = {Infiltration of molten calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicates (CMAS) through thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) causes structural degradation of TBC layers. The infiltration kinetics can be altered by careful tailoring of the electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) microstructure such as feather arm lengths and inter-columnar gaps, etc. Morphology of the feathery columns and their inherent porosities directly influences the infiltration kinetics of molten CMAS. To understand the influence of columnar morphology on the kinetics of the CAMS flow, a finite element based parametric model was developed for describing a variety of EB-PVD top coat microstructures. A detailed numerical study was performed considering fluid-solid interactions (FSI) between the CMAS and TBC top coat (TC). The CMAS flow characteristics through these microstructures were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, correlations between the morphological parameters and CMAS flow kinetics were established. It was shown that the rate of longitudinal and lateral infiltration could be minimized by reducing the gap between columns and increasing the length of the feather arms. The results also show that the microstructures with long feather arms having a lower lateral inclination decrease the CMAS infiltration rate, therefore, reduce the CMAS infiltration depth. The analyses allow the identification of key morphological features that are important for mitigating the CMAS infiltration.},

abstract = {The present study reports a theoretical investigation of capillary transport of microbead suspension in microfluidic channels with finite size reservoirs at the inlet. The reservoir–microchannel combination is often the case in Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) where biomolecules are transported using capillary force. To demonstrate such finite reservoir effect, the reservoir is placed vertically above the microchannel. Under such condition, the pressure field expression at the rectangular microchannel inlet is deduced. Appropriate correlations for effective physical properties are used to account for the presence of microbeads in the working fluid, mimicking biomolecules in actual LOC. The non-dimensional governing equation for capillary flow with finite size reservoir is derived based on the balance among the surface, viscous and gravity forces acting on the fluid front. The numerical solution of governing equation is obtained to investigate the impact of several operating parameters on the flow front progression. It is observed that the aspect ratio of the microchannel and reservoir play vital roles in deciding the behavior and magnitude of flow front progression in the microfluidic channels. Capillarity and gravity force dominant regions during the progression is observed. The microchannel width and reservoir width decide the interplay between gravity and capillarity. Although higher fluid level in the reservoir has an added advantage for more gravitational head, the resistance from the reservoir makes the flow front progress slowly at the beginning of the capillary transport. It is also found that microbead volume fraction in the working fluid plays an important role in delaying the capillary transport under various operating conditions. Hence, it can be concluded that the use of reservoir at the inlet of microfluidic channels has an impact on the overall capillary transport of biomolecules in LOC devices.}

The error is estimated with power series expansions as a function of the typical cell size. These expansions, of which four types are used, are fitted to the data in the least-squares sense. The selection of the best error estimate is based on the standard deviation of the fits. The error estimate is converted into an uncertainty with a safety factor that depends on the observed order of grid convergence and on the standard deviation of the fit. For well-behaved data sets, i.e. monotonic convergence with the expected observed order of grid convergence and no scatter in the data, the method reduces to the well known Grid Convergence Index. Examples of application of the procedure are included.}

Recently, a new failure mode of TBCs caused by calcium–magnesium–alumina–silicate (CMAS) glass has attracted increasing attention. In this paper, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBCs produced by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) were exposed to CMAS deposits at 1250°C. The microstructure evolution and failure mechanism of the coatings were investigated. It has been shown that CMAS glass penetrated into the YSZ ceramic layer along the inter-columnar gaps and interacted with YSZ. As a result, an interaction zone of about 20μm thickness, which was the mixture of CMAS and YSZ with equiaxial structure, was formed in the YSZ surface layer after 4h heat-treatment at 1250°C. Meanwhile, yttria in YSZ layer as a stabilizer was dissolved in CMAS glass and caused accelerated monoclinic phase transformation. After 8h heat-treatment, degradation of YSZ TBC occurred by delamination cracking of YSZ layer, which is quite different from the traditional failure caused by interfacial cracking at the YSZ/metallic bond coat. Physical models have been built to describe the failure mechanism of EB-PVD TBCs attacked by CMAS deposits.},

   abstract = {Over the last decade a significant amount of research has been conducted into the durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) focusing mainly on issues of oxidation, erosion and foreign object damage (FOD). However, as the performance and durability of TBCs has improved the temperatures at which they operate has increased. This increase in temperature has resulted in another lifing issue for EB PVD TBCs, namely that of CMAS attack. Calcium–magnesium–alumino-silicate (CMAS) attack occurs when atmospheric dust that has deposited on the surface of turbine blades melts and wicks into the columns of the TBC. This occurs at temperatures above 1240–1260°C and results in the degradation of the columnar microstructure of the TBCs. Due to the fact that TBCs operate in a temperature gradient CMAS only infiltrates part of the coating before solidifying. There are a number of issues associated with CMAS attack, both chemical and mechanical. From a chemical point of view CMAS attack of electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposited (PVD) TBCs can be considered as a form of corrosion; when there is a lot of excess CMAS on the surface of a coated component Yttria diffuses out of the TBC into the molten CMAS resulting in a t′ to monoclinic phase transformation in the yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ), CMAS attack also results in localised melting and subsequent re-precipitation of the coating resulting in a loss of the defined columnar microstructure. While from a mechanical point of view the CMAS, once re-solidified, reduces the strain compliance of the EB PVD and can result in spallation of the TBC on cooling. Furthermore, current studies have indicated that small amount of CMAS infiltration significantly increases the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs. This paper covers various aspects of CMAS attack of EB PVD TBCs, specifically looking at minimum levels of CMAS required to initiate damage, as well as investigating it from an erosion–corrosion perspective.},

We also report the enthalpy of mixing between the coatings and molten silicate after combining the results measured by high-temperature solution calorimetry with enthalpies of fusion measured by drop-and-catch calorimetry and differential thermal analysis. The enthalpies of solution of selected silicate and zirconia-based coatings and apatite reaction products are moderately positive except for 7YSZ, yttria-stabilized zirconia. Apatite formation is only favorable over coating dissolution in terms of enthalpy for 7YSZ. The enthalpies of mixing between the coatings and the molten silicate are less exothermic for Yb2Si2O7 and CaYb4Si3O13 than for 7YSZ, indicating lower energetic stability of the latter against molten silicate corrosion.

   abstract = {Due to the serious consequences that calcium‑magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) attack has on reducing the service life of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), it is important to understand the degradation mechanisms of CMAS attack on TBCs. Air plasma sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings were tested with 20 mg/cm2 real volcanic ash (VA) deposits at 1150 °C and 1250 °C for 8 h. The thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the coatings subjected to VA attack were investigated. It was found that VA reacted top coat exhibited apparently higher coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, hardness and Young's modulus values than the as-sprayed condition. The microstructure and phase evolution of the coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Raman and transmission electron microscope. The results indicated that Y was leached from YSZ and into the VA melt, which interacted with VA to form yttrium iron garnet, resulting in the detrimental phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic.},

   abstract = {The CMAS associated degradation of 7YSZ TBC layers is one of the serious problems in the aero engines that operate in dusty environments. CMAS infiltrates into TBC at high temperatures and stiffens the TBC which ultimately loses its strain tolerance and gets delaminated. The EB-PVD technique is used to coat TBCs exhibiting a columnar microstructure on parts such as blades and on vanes. By varying the EB-PVD process parameters, columnar morphology and porosity of the 7YSZ coating is changed and its effect on the CMAS infiltration behaviour is studied in detail. Two different TBC pore geometries were created and infiltration experiments were carried out at 1250°C and 1225°C for different time intervals. The 7YSZ coating with more ‘feathery’ features has resulted in higher CMAS resistance by at least by a factor of 2 than its less ‘feathery’ counterpart. These results are explained on the basis of a proposed physical model.},

   abstract = {The ingestion of CMAS (Calcium-Magnesium-Alumino-Silicate) particles into aircraft engines is an issue for both the safety and resilience of aircraft. CMAS ingestion process can erode compressor blades, erode/infiltration thermal barrier coatings, and lead to overheating and stall. To better understand the physical details, this paper presents a novel approach to exploring individual CMAS dynamics in the context of melting particles. The methodology was accomplished by resolving the details of a single CMAS particle using the volume-of-fluid method. To account for thermal properties of the flow and particle, melting-solidification modeling was implemented. The particle was initialized at a stagnant condition with a temperature under its solidus temperature. The flow around the particle was initialized at turbine relevant conditions, including high velocities and temperatures above the particle’s liquidus temperature. Transient conditions were explored in context of non-dimensional numbers (including slip Reynold’s Number, Weber number, and Ohnesorge number), as well as several ratios (ρs/ρg and Ts/T∞). For validation, sensitivity to mesh and input, as well as experimental comparisons were examined. The experimental comparison benchmarked the temperature ratio of particles at varying thermal Stokes numbers against the experimental correlation shown in Bojdo et al. [1].},

abstract = {The strain tolerance of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in gas turbine engines is enhanced by incorporation of through-thickness pores within the coating. However, molten calcium–magnesium–alumino–silicate (CMAS) deposits are then able to permeate through the interconnected pore network resulting in dissolution of the coating in the silicate melt, precipitation of new phases, and the elimination of the pores needed for strain tolerance when silicate melt solidification occurs upon cooling. Here we used an electron beam directed vapor deposition method to deposit strain tolerant coatings containing a high volume fraction of inter-columnar pores to assess the effect of increasing the pore volume fraction upon silicate melt infiltration in a 7wt.% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC. We then explore two potential mitigation approaches. One investigated the infiltration of a samarium zirconate (SZO) coating deposited on a 7wt.% yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) buffer layer since recent work has indicated the related gadolinium zirconate (GZO) system was much more CMAS resistant than 7YSZ. The second explored the effects of an embedded platinum layer located near the outer surface of the SZO layer. The response of both systems to attack by a model 33CaO–9MgO–13AlO1.5–45SiO2 CMAS melt at 1250°C has been compared to that of the 7YSZ composition coating deposited by the same process. The 7YSZ specimens were fully infiltrated by CMAS in less than 1min and significantly dissolved and re-precipitated a globular phase after 4h of exposure. The penetration rate in SZO coatings was reduced by about a factor of five, but the coatings were still completely penetrated after a 4hour exposure. Significant SZO dissolution and precipitation of both globular fluorite and faceted apatite phases were observed after the 4h of exposure, with concomitant debonding at the SZO/YSZ interface. The insertion of a 5μm thick Pt layer about 30μm below the SZO surface arrested permeation of CMAS for about 16h and might provide a promising strategy for controlling CMAS degradation in TBCs without reducing the thermo-cyclic delamination resistance.}

   abstract = {Two standard 7YSZ coatings were deposited by EB-PVD techniques and tested against CMAS infiltration at short time intervals (up to 8 min.) at 1250 °C in air. They exhibited different microstructures, i.e. porosities and microstructural features. Two species of CMAS with different compositions were used and their viscosities were determined using the concentric cylinder method and their contact angles were measured using high temperature heating microscopy. The theoretical viscosities, which were calculated using a statistical model based on the chemical composition of the melts, differed from the measured values of the viscosities by one order of magnitude. A large variation in the contact angles within a very short range of temperature (1243–1266 °C) was observed as well. The porosity and surface area measurements were performed on both EB-PVD microstructures using the nitrogen physisorption method. Additionally, the produced coatings exhibited porosities of 14.5 and 29.5 percent and the infiltration experiments have shown that the more porous coating provides higher infiltration resistance. The effect of porosity on CMAS infiltration kinetics was investigated and the results elucidate that the porosity network plays a more preeminent role than the amount of porosity. The experimental infiltration results have been compared with calculated infiltration data using a novel mathematical approach proposed in previous studies in which the permeability of the coatings is assessed with two contrasting methods termed “concentric pipe” and “open pipe” models. The infiltration was calculated by incorporating the experimentally determined properties such as contact angle, viscosity and porosity. A fitting parameter has been derived from the equations for the geometry factor for both microstructures. The calculated and experimental results are in good agreement with the concentric pipe model supporting the validity of this CMAS infiltration model.},

This study focuses on quantifying the effect of CMAS on the thermal properties and heat transport in TBCs. The thermal properties of a 7wt.\% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) TBC deposited on a superalloy substrate by air plasma spray (APS) were measured before and after CMAS infiltration. A rise in both volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coating was observed upon infiltration. Calculations to explain these trends were performed for a model TBC system and found to be in good agreement with the measured results. The evolution of the phase constitution of the coating was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and the integrity of the interface was characterized by optical examination of cross sections. These tests determined that the coating remained in good contact with the substrate and experienced no phase change after infiltration.}

Various physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the glass have been evaluated. Bulk density of CMAS glass was 2.69g/cm3, Young׳s modulus 92GPa, Shear modulus 36GPa, Poisson׳s ratio 0.28, dilatometric glass transition temperature (Tg) 706°C, softening point (Td) 764°C, Vickers microhardness 6.3±0.4GPa, indentation fracture toughness 0.75±0.15MPa.m1/2, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) 9.8×10−6/°C in the temperature range 25 to 700°C. Temperature dependence of viscosity has also been estimated from various reference points of the CMAS glass using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation as well as from the glass composition. The glass remained amorphous after heat treating at 850°C for 10h but crystallized into CaSiO3 and Ca2Mg0.5AlSi1.5O7 phases at 900°C or higher temperatures. Crystallization kinetics of the CMAS glass has also been investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA).}

We describe the evolution in the thermal properties of a 7 wt.\% Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 electron beam-physical vapor deposited (EB-PVD) thermal barrier coating with thermal cycling between room temperature and 1150°C until failure. The thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the coating were evaluated non-destructively based on the analysis of its photothermal infrared emission. Although the coating density does not increase significantly with thermal cycling, the thermal diffusivity and conductivity of the coating increased substantially, particularly during the first 20 1h cycles. The values then approach a limiting value. Complementary Raman spectroscopy suggests that the increase is accompanied by a reduction in the defect concentration in the coating and that there is also a correlation between the width of the Raman lines and the thermal conductivity.}

Sessile droplet models are presented and used to compute the contact angle at high temperatures and compared with experiments. The study also investigates the sensitivity of deposition patterns to the Stokes number and the results identify local vulnerability regions.
